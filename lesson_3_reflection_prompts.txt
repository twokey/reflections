Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A: I would want to use remote repository when I want to share my work with other people.
Also, I can use it when I work on the same project from different machines.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: It is more convenient to pull changes manually because when someone push changes to
GitHub it will create a new commit. Probably I don't want to have that commit in my 
local repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
A: Forks are copies of the same repository on GitHub. Clones are coppies of the same
repository on GitHub and local computer. Also, it is possible to create clones on a 
local machine. Technically forks are clones on GitHub. Branches are differen labels
for commits on local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
